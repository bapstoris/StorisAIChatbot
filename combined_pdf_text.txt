COMMON WINDOWS O/S INSTALL ISSUES: 
 
Windows 10/11: 
When setting up or reformatting the Windows O/S, you may be unable to see/select a 
drive and receive the following ERROR: 
 
 "Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. 
On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed to GPT disks.”   
 
Solution: 
1. Hold Shift + F10 to open command prompt: 
diskpart 
list disk 
select disk <disk number>  (ie. select disk 1) 
clean 
convert gpt 
exit 
 
Windows 11: 
When formatting a new Windows 11 device, you may find that you’re unable to continue 
the setup without connecting to internet. This can be bypassed using the following: 
 
Solution: 
1. You can press SHIFT + F10 to open the CMD Prompt 
2. Enter OOBE\BYPASSNRO    (This bypasses the network requirement for the O/S 
setup so new O/S doesn’t force a MS login. Ie. Local netcom user can be created)
